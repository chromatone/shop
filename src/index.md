## Unlock the Colors of Music

Experience music in a whole new way with Chromatone's innovative colored note system. Simply touch the color you want to hear and unleash the power of synesthesia, a unique way where your senses connect. See the colors, feel the sound.

## Effortless Learning & Creative Play

We offer high quality vinyl instrument stickers. They work with all MIDI keyboards, guitar, ukulele and other tonal instruments. Once carefully applied they may last months of regular playing and can become a solid bridge to come from colors to notes. Once not needed, they can be easily removed with common rubbing alcohol, which is also quite safe for most of musical surfaces.

**Free worldwide shipping** is included! Upgrade to tracked shipping for added peace of mind.
